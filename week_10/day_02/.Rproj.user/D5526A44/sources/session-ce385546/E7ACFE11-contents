## Supervided vs unsupervised learning


### Learning objectives

 -   Become aware of the types of problem ML can be used for
 -  Know the difference between supervised and unsupervised algorithms


### 3 types of problems

- Regression
  - supervised
  
- Classification
  - supervised
  
- Clustering
  - unsupervised
  
  
  > What does supervised means?
  
  for each 'x' we know the corresponding 'y'
  
  for each cat picture, we know that it is indeed a cat (or not)!
  
  
  We have a label for each individual.... which we can use to verify the models conclusions
  
  > unsupervised means there are no labels.
  
  These methods shouldn't be thought of in isolation
  
  Maybe:
  
  cluster => identify groups (i.e. labels)
          => regression

## 2.1 Part 1

Question 1.
Take the data in the dataset qb_revenue_breakdown and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset. 

```{r}
ggplot(qb_revenue_breakdown)+
  geom_bar(aes(x = product, fill = year), position = "dodge")
```
Question 2.
Make a line chart showing monthly sales of the “flagship product” - the ‘KwikBit Unit 1’ - over the last year. This data is inside qb_monthly_sales, but you will need to use filter() or subset() (base R).



```{r}
qb_monthly_sales_KwikBit <- qb_monthly_sales %>% 
 filter(cashflow == "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales" & year(date) == 2019) 

?subset

ggplot(qb_monthly_sales_KwikBit)+
  geom_line(aes(x = amount, y = date))
```


Question 3.
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in qb_monthly_sales.


```{r}
qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales" & year(date) == 2019)

remove(qb_monthly_sales_year)

ggplot(qb_monthly_sales %>% filter(year(date) == 2019 & cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales"))+
  geom_line(aes(x = date, y = amount, group= cashflow, colour = cashflow))+
  labs(
    x = "months_2019",
    y = "revenue_costs"
  )

?year()

```


Question 4.
Show annual sales of personal fitness trackers over the last 5 years broken down by company as a ribbon plot (use geom_area). This data is in qb_competitors.



```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors %>% 
  mutate(revenue_thousands = revenue/1000))+
  geom_area(aes(x = year, y = revenue_thousands, group = company, fill = company))


?geom_area

```


Question 5.
Now show the sales from the four competitors as a line graph. Include an extra layer that shows the data points used to make the lines.


```{r}
ggplot(qb_competitors)+
    geom_line(aes(x = year, y = revenue, group = company, color = company))+
 geom_point(aes(x = year, y = revenue, color = company), stat = "identity")
```


Question 6.
Now the company wants to compare the number of steps that their device counts vs. their competitors. Make a line graph of the number of steps throughout time, and use faceting to compare between companies and people. The data for this is in qb_device_data. 

```{r}
ggplot(qb_device_data)+
  aes(x = hours, y = counts, group = device, colour = device)+
  geom_line()+
  facet_wrap(~device)

```

## 2.2 Part 2

Question 1.
Take the plots that you produced in part one and now polish them by:

  - Adding appropriate labels
  -  Changing the scales and coordinates when appropriate.
  -  Applying a unified theme, which is described below:

  -  Graphs should have white backgrounds, and use colour sparingly.
  -  There should be faint grid lines.
  -  Font sizes should be ~12pt although titles should be slightly larger and axis labels can be slightly smaller.
  -  All plots should use colours from the following company colour scheme.
  
  
```{r}
col_scheme <- c("#E89FE9", "#50434F", "#B6A7B5", "#F9A472", "#BD7040")
```
  

# Queation1_Part1


Take the data in the dataset qb_revenue_breakdown and make a stacked bar chart showing the sources of revenue across the two years in the dataset. 

```{r}
ggplot(qb_revenue_breakdown)+
  geom_bar(aes(x = product, fill = year), position = "dodge")+
  labs(
    x = "source_of_revenue",
    y = "revenue"
  )+
theme_grey()+
  scale_fill_manual(
    values = c(
      "2018" = "#E89FE9",
      "2019" = "#F9A472"
    )
  )

  labs(
    x = "sales",
    y = "months_2019"
  )+
  theme_light()
```


Question 3.
Make a line chart showing monthly revenue and costs over the last year. This data is also in qb_monthly_sales.


```{r}
qb_monthly_sales %>% 
  filter(cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales" & year(date) == 2019)

remove(qb_monthly_sales_year)

ggplot(qb_monthly_sales %>% filter(year(date) == 2019 & cashflow != "Kwikbit Unit 1 Sales"))+

# Classification vs Clustering

#Both *Classification* and *Clustering* are method of pattern identification. The main difference between the two is that:

#- the first is a form of `Supervised learning`, meaning that the labels are predefined, already assigned; it is used to predict whether or not any new data point belongs to one of the original group of labels.
#- the second is instead a form of `Unsupervised learning`, meaning that identify itself similarities among objects dividing them into groups, which are known as `clusters`.
